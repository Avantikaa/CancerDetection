Cancer Detection with SVM and KNN,
KNN is a supervised learning algorithm used for classification and regression problem.

KNN is a supervised learning algorithm which means training data is labeled. Consider the task of classifying a green circle between class 1 and class 2.


If we choose k=1, then green circle will go into class 1 as it is closer to the class 1. If K=3, then there are ‘two’ class 2 objects and ‘one’ class one object. So KNN will classify the green circle in class 2 as it forms the majority.
